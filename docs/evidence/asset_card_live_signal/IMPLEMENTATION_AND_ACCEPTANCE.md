# Asset-card live signal implementation evidence

Package: `V41_ASSET_CARD_LIVE_SIGNAL_CLOSURE`.
Scope: Appendix I; the existing 48-path implementation allowlist is unchanged.
Registered starting SHA: `094b70a8ed31891999da0814fae5add09e2c4e08`.
Merged authorization baseline: `2c71f1cd36ea7da6b7c5cf7d4d737aa4a70099b2` (PR #1294).
Implementation worktree: `/private/tmp/trine-v41-asset-card-live-signal-closure`.
Branch: `codex/v4-1-asset-card-live-signal-closure`.

## Status and boundaries

- Current mainline/block: existing V4.1 work, asset-card-only live signal closure.
- Capability movement: independent card data, model, risk and rendering infrastructure; **not production-model readiness**.
- User-visible output after a separately authorized deployment: local card field updates, eight direction labels, independent confidence/risk and compact clock.
- Overreach boundary: no canonical Decision/Plan, position, Three-AI, Telegram, login, Cloudflare, pool membership/ranking, native/mobile-specific implementation or production changes.
- No merge or deployment is authorized for this business PR. No external persistent database, real AI, Telegram or trade calls were made during this implementation.
- Owner position records were not accessed or modified. Tests use local fixtures; test fixtures are not production training data.
- `CURRENT_PHASE_DONE=NO`; runtime acceptance and production-model gates remain open.

## Implemented paths through the card domain

1. `AssetCardMarketDataService`: independent Binance **Spot trades**, closed bars and sequence-validated diff-depth; existing observation-pool union determines subscriptions. GETs never add subscriptions. Public initial-depth bootstrap is rate-limited, response-bounded and rejects stale socket/epoch callbacks. Quote timestamps are independent from signal timestamps. No futures mark-price fallback.
2. `AssetCardFeatureService`: point-in-time closed 5m/15m/1h/4h inputs; actual depth/spread and cached CoinGlass observations. Availability time is checked separately from observation time. A coincident close waits for the expected timeframe windows within the 15-second inference budget rather than permanently binding an older 1h/4h window.
3. `AssetCardModelBundle` and offline script: separate long/short XGBoost and Beta calibration, temporal purged walk-forward splits and four-hour embargo, fixed-ATR first-passage labels, exclusion of unresolved bar ambiguity, independent validation/threshold selection and final testing. Checksummed atomic bundles bind feature/model/calibration/threshold/dataset identities and asset coverage. No production threshold or fallback probability is invented.
4. `AssetCardSignalService`: pure eight-direction state machine, two distinct consecutive closes for direction transitions, version/mode isolation and explicit invalidation. Replayed closes cannot accumulate confirmations. Raw model probabilities remain audit-only in SHADOW.
5. `AssetCardRiskService`: eight independent assessments, actual units/timestamps and versioned asset-history distributions. Missing evidence/history returns UNKNOWN. Known HIGH/MEDIUM survives missing unrelated evidence; LOW requires complete assessments. Active MEDIUM/HIGH items are limited to three, ordered by severity, signal-invalidation effect and evidence time.
6. `AssetCardEvidenceService`: cache peeks only, full canonical instrument/source version/dataset/window validation. OI uses CURRENT; funding/long-short/liquidation use 1M, matching their existing owners. The existing freshness policy is applied once. Individual provider/event-source failures do not erase other valid evidence. Event timestamps require actual source publication, not inferred event-time fallbacks.
7. `AssetCardService`: background-only inference/risk/price ownership; private snapshot runtime state and card feature audits support recovery without repeating inference or reviving a pre-invalidation state. Latest input freshness is separate from a prior confirmed signal's structural anchor. Request methods are reads only. `_runtime` persistence metadata is removed before API serialization and is not in SSE payloads.
8. `DashboardHomeServiceImpl` attaches the independent `cardSignal` only after existing canonical ranking/projection. Controller card reconciliation uses the existing authenticated runtime-snapshot GET with `view=ASSET_CARDS`, at most six distinct pool members and Session identity only. Canonical fields, full pool membership and other Home regions are preserved.
9. `home-runtime.js`: PRICE/SIGNAL/RISK/HEALTH update only their card fields. Per-symbol/per-field-group versions reject stale responses without dropping a lower-version signal merely because a later price arrived first. Prices are coalesced to 1.5 seconds. One 60-second card reconciliation and a disconnected-only 15-second fallback pause while hidden. No card event calls `loadHome`. Existing unrelated system-status handling is not claimed to be removed.

## Risk production wiring and limits

| Type | Card-domain evidence | Missing-evidence behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CHASE | Structural center distance and extension in signal-time ATR units | UNKNOWN without validated history |
| SHOCK | Actual closed 1m and 5m volatility | UNKNOWN per missing metric/history |
| REVERSAL | Closed 5m/1h/4h slope conflict and explicit structural breach | UNKNOWN without history; proven breach can independently produce HIGH |
| CROWDING | Funding, long/short ratio, OI change with their actual units | UNKNOWN; no aggregate-risk proxy |
| LIQUIDATION | Long/short liquidation amounts and imbalance | UNKNOWN; no fixed CoinGlass-presence grade |
| LIQUIDITY | Actual spread, covered 10/25bps depth and book imbalance | UNKNOWN; no 24h-range substitute |
| EVENT | Existing current macro/news facts with source publication and explicit severity | No matching event is not proof of complete coverage; UNKNOWN |
| DATA | Core Spot identity, completeness/freshness and source-loss facts | First-time absence UNKNOWN; confirmed source loss invalidates without reversing direction |

All eight production calculation branches are connected. This is **not** evidence that all eight have sufficient real historical distributions or live coverage. There are no real trained/calibrated artifacts in this change.

## Database definitions

V24 was the next unused migration after V23 on the merged baseline. The change adds only:

- `tm_asset_card_snapshot`
- `tm_asset_card_spot_bar`
- `tm_asset_card_feature_history`
- `idx_asset_card_spot_available`
- `idx_asset_card_feature_available`

`schema.sql` retains its original content and appends only corresponding card tables/indexes. Migration DDL has three new tables, zero alterations of existing tables, zero data-mutation statements and zero privilege statements. No Staging/Production migration was run. Runtime writes are confined to these card-owned stores.

## Validation evidence (local, 2026-09-10)

- Focused card/Home suite: 259 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 1 opt-in native interoperability skip, before the final small clock/replay assertions.
- Final full Maven: **5,378 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 21 skips**, exit 0. An earlier run had one frontend harness failure and seven local socket-bind errors. The harness now loads the real error handler and tracks card reconciliation separately from Home refresh; original timer assertions remain. The seven existing mock-HTTP tests passed with local loopback binding available; no real Telegram calls were made.
- Frontend card matrix (including timezone subprocesses), timestamp matrix, JavaScript syntax and `git diff --check`: PASS.
- Product Source Gate, task validation, exact machine-gate self-tests and workflow contract: PASS. Runtime handoff output on preserved WIP can still say `BLOCKED_WORKTREE_DIRTY`; this is reported, not bypassed or rewritten as a clean-tree PASS.
- Offline Python tests using the already installed pinned environment: 15 PASS, 1 ERROR: XGBoost cannot load the missing system `libomp.dylib`. No system library was installed; the failing native test was not deleted/skipped to conceal this error.
- Java/Python UBJSON interoperability is separately opt-in (`-DassetCard.testPython=...`) and has **not** passed locally. A compatible CPU/OpenMP environment must run it before claiming native interoperability readiness.
- CI coverage correction: the repository's existing `ci` profile selects `smoke | core-regression`, not the full suite. The card calculation/market/risk/model, Mapper/V24 and Home projection/rendering tests now carry the existing `core-regression` tag. No workflow, global gate or existing assertion was removed or relaxed. The earlier 1,090-test CI run is not presented as card-test coverage; the updated exact-head run must include these tests.

## Remaining evidence and release limitations

`MODEL_MODE=SHADOW` (default; feature disabled until a separately authorized runtime configuration).
`PRODUCTION_MODEL_READY=NO`.
Real training/calibration samples: no real training performed in this work; counts NOT_AVAILABLE.
Real Brier/ECE/LogLoss: NOT_AVAILABLE, not values derived from test fixtures.
Real price/model/risk latency: NOT_MEASURED. The 1.5-second renderer, one-second background tick and bounded closed-bar wait are tested mechanisms, not live SLA evidence.
PostgreSQL/container checks need an available Docker/PostgreSQL environment; local skips are not a migration acceptance claim.
Business PR/CI: pending. Merge: not executed. Staging/Production deployment: not executed.
No official-domain acceptance is claimed for undeployed code.
