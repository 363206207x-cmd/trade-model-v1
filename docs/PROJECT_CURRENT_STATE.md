## Effective State Rule

Compatibility note: `scripts/v1-state.sh` still prints `CURRENT_PHASE: P0-0` as the contract-baseline phase. The active delivery handoff is tracked by `Current Work Package`, `Next Business Phase`, and the Delivery Progress Matrix.

P0-0 is effective only because its DONE commit is merged to `main`, local `main` is synced, and the worktree was clean when the runtime gate evaluated it.

P0-1 UserPosition is effective because its implementation is merged to clean / synced `main`.

P0-2 ExecutionPlan Source Gate is effective because its implementation is merged to clean / synced `main` and the runtime gate allowed P0-3.

P0-3 AccountRisk integrates UserPosition is effective because its implementation is merged to clean / synced `main` and the runtime gate allowed P0-4.

P0-4 PositionMonitorLog is effective because its implementation is merged to clean / synced `main` and the runtime gate allowed P0-5.

P0-5 PositionMonitorService is effective because its implementation is merged to clean / synced `main` and the runtime gate allowed P0-6.

P0-6 Review integrates UserPosition is effective because its implementation is merged to clean / synced `main` and the runtime gate allowed P1-1.

P1-1 PushRecheck semantic hardening is effective because its implementation is merged to clean / synced `main` and the runtime gate allowed P1-2.

P1-2 ConfusedState + AiConflict hardening is effective because its implementation is merged to clean / synced `main` and the runtime gate allowed P1-3.

P1-3 HotReset real action is effective because its implementation is merged to clean / synced `main` and the runtime gate allowed P1-4.

P1-4 OpportunityLog is effective because its implementation is merged to clean / synced `main` by PR #1017 and the runtime gate allowed P2-1.

P2-1 Macro / News / External Context is effective because its implementation is merged to clean / synced `main` by PR #1018 commit `d7fef874b39aabbd07f6b05fd97f4725e89e79b5` and the runtime gate allowed P2-2.

P2-2 AI Orchestrator + AiCallLog is effective because its implementation is merged to clean / synced `main` by PR #1019 commit `92fd7cbf17db31c8ea2bfd4673badde1c69d20cd` and the runtime gate allowed P2-3.

P2-3 Scheduler / Idempotency / Trace is effective because its implementation is merged to clean / synced `main` by PR #1020 commit `5c2b2b47eb7fa4cfc9c428ef022375f4ca890b23` and runtime state allowed P3-1 to proceed.

P3-1 Dashboard Final is effective because its final homepage UI layout is merged to clean / synced `main` by PR #1023 commit `f543832cf5907fe00920ca3f05666566daa16b7a`, full Maven validation passed, and the merged PR changed only `src/main/resources/templates/dashboard.html`.

P3-2 Full E2E Acceptance is effective because its acceptance evidence is merged to clean / synced `main` by PR #1025 Dashboard Manual UserPosition Binding, PR #1027 Full UserPosition lifecycle E2E acceptance, and PR #1028 Dashboard E2E state proof / commit `1b08abd`. Full Maven validation, delivery check, and `v1-state` pass on clean / synced main.

P3-3 Final Delivery & System Freeze is effective because final docs/status closure now records the local acceptance-ready freeze state on clean / synced `main`: full Maven validation passed, delivery check passed, `v1-state` passed with blockers none, `/api/dashboard/home` returned HTTP 200 success with the expected Dashboard Home shape, and `/api/review/center` returned HTTP 200 success with the expected Review Center shape.

---

## Current Allowed Work

Only the following work is allowed after this P3-3 docs/status closure:

1. Autodeliver this PDR-2C2A mapper PostgreSQL upsert variant package if approved.
2. Keep P3-3 V1 local acceptance-ready final freeze effective.
3. Prepare PDR-2C2B Mapper PostgreSQL Date Function Compatibility only under a separate explicit production-readiness package.
4. Preserve Production Deployment Readiness as BLOCKED until a separate production release gate clears it.

---

## Current Forbidden Work

The following work remains blocked after this P3-3 closure:

1. Java business service/controller code, schema.sql, Flyway migration SQL, dashboard, review UI, API contract, unrelated business test, script, scheduler, Push, Telegram, order, execution, auto-trading, runtime application config, default Flyway activation, PostgreSQL connection, or trading-logic changes inside this PDR-2C2A mapper upsert package.
2. Production-ready claims.
3. Telegram send, Push send, external-channel delivery, order placement, execution, auto-open, auto-close, or auto-trading of any kind.
4. Treating this local acceptance freeze as production deployment approval.

---

## Current Known Critical Gaps

1. Production deployment remains blocked by non-production runtime/config evidence.
2. P3-3 Final Delivery & System Freeze completion does not prove production readiness, Push send, Telegram send, external channel, order execution, or auto-trading capability.
3. Production-readiness remediation remains a separate future scope and requires a separate human release gate.

## P3-2 Full E2E Acceptance Closure

Merged main evidence:

1. `DecisionServiceImplTest.getLatestDecisionResultsDoesNotInferOpenPositionFromTriggeredDecisionWithoutManualUserPosition` proves ExecutionPlan / triggered DecisionResult state without UserPosition does not render as an opened position.
2. `DecisionServiceImplTest.getLatestDecisionResultBySymbolUsesManualOpenUserPositionAsDashboardPositionSource` proves manual OPEN UserPosition is the dashboard real-position source.
3. `DecisionServiceImplTest.getLatestDecisionResultBySymbolExcludesClosedAndNonManualUserPositionRows` and `countOpenPositionsCountsOnlyManualOpenUserPositions` prove CLOSED and non-MANUAL UserPosition rows are excluded from open dashboard display.
4. `UserPositionFullLifecycleE2EAcceptanceTest.manualUserPositionFlowsThroughMonitorCloseReviewAndRuleFeedbackWithoutExecutableSurfaces` proves the UserPosition -> PositionMonitor -> manual close -> Review -> rule feedback chain.
5. `DashboardControllerTest.summary_json_exposesManualUserPositionFieldsAndKeepsExecutionPlanOnlyRowsNonPosition`, `dashboardTemplateHomePositionReadsOnlyManualUserPositionReadModelFields`, `StaticNoTradeInstructionGuardTest.dashboardPositionExecutionRowKeepsManualPositionDisplayPassive`, and `CandidatePushReviewOnlyMvpClosureTest.dashboardDisplaysInternalPushPreviewAsDisabledReviewOnlySurface` prove dashboard E2E key states and safety anchors.
6. `PositionMonitorServiceImplTest` and `PositionMonitorLogServiceImplTest` prove HOLD / LOGIC_WEAKENED / PLAN_INVALIDATED monitor outcomes and one-log monitor persistence.
7. `UserPositionRiskAdapterTest` and `PositionMonitorServiceImplTest.riskBlockedAndRiskIncreasedAreFailClosed` prove AccountRisk high-risk blocking.
8. `PushRecheckServiceImplTest` proves PushRecheck risk/confused/drifted/expired behavior remains review-only and does not create UserPosition.
9. `ConfusedStateServiceImplTest` and `HotResetServiceImplTest` prove ConfusedState and HotReset safety states.
10. `UserPositionReviewAdapterTest` and `ReviewControllerUserPositionReviewTest` prove Review execution deviation and rule feedback.
11. `OpportunityLogServiceImplTest`, `MacroEventServiceImplTest`, `NewsEventServiceImplTest`, `ExternalContextEvidenceBuilderTest`, `AiDecisionOrchestratorServiceImplTest`, and `AiCallLogServiceImplTest` prove the remaining contract E2E evidence around OpportunityLog, Macro / News, AI fallback, and AiCallLog.
12. `./mvnw test -q` passed on clean / synced `main`.
13. `bash scripts/v1-delivery-check.sh` passed on clean / synced `main`.
14. `bash scripts/v1-state.sh` passed with `WORKTREE_CLEAN: Yes`, `OPEN_PR_STATUS: NONE`, `MAIN_SYNC: OK`, `CLEAN_SYNCED_MAIN: YES`, and `BLOCKERS: none`.

P3-2 Full E2E Acceptance is DONE/effective as E2E acceptance evidence. Production Deployment Readiness remains BLOCKED and no production-ready claim is made.

## P3-3 Final Delivery & System Freeze Closure

Final local acceptance-ready freeze evidence:

1. `GET /api/dashboard/home` returned HTTP 200 success with `header`, `systemState`, `assets`, `positions`, `executionSuggestion`, `aiDecision`, `pushInbox`, `diagnostics`, and `safety`.
2. Dashboard Home Aggregation API is merged/effective.
3. Dashboard Data Fill P1-P5 are merged/effective: decision/systemState/assets, manual positions/executionSuggestion, AI role evidence, pushInbox readonly data, and Telegram readonly status contract.
4. Push Inbox remains readonly.
5. Telegram status remains `WAITING_SYNC` until a verified status source exists; no Telegram send is implemented.
6. `GET /api/review/center` returned HTTP 200 success with `summary`, `positionReviews`, `opportunityReviews`, `pushReviews`, and `ruleFeedback`.
7. `/review/dashboard` exists as the Review Center route; four tabs exist: 持仓复盘 / 机会复盘 / 推送复盘 / 规则反馈.
8. Review Center data is readonly and does not fabricate records.
9. Mainline validation passed on `main`: clean worktree before closure, no open PRs, MAIN_SYNC OK, full Maven PASS, delivery check PASS, and `v1-state` blockers none.
10. P0-0 through P3-2 remain DONE/effective.
11. Production Deployment Readiness remains BLOCKED.
12. No production deployment approval is granted.
13. No order / execution / auto-trading capability exists.

P3-3 Final Delivery & System Freeze is DONE/effective as a local acceptance-ready / read-only decision support / review workflow freeze. It is not production deployment ready.

---

## Current Deployment Readiness

Production deployment remains BLOCKED.

Blocking evidence:

- `src/main/resources/application.yml` uses `jdbc:h2:mem:trade_model_v1`.
- `src/main/resources/application.yml` has empty datasource password.
- `src/main/resources/application.yml` and `src/main/resources/application.properties` enable H2 console.
- `src/main/resources/application.properties` defaults `position.provider.type` to `SIMULATED`.
- PDR-1 added `src/main/resources/application-prod.yml` and `ProductionProfileSafetyGuard`, but this is only a production config/profile safety gate and does not prove production deployment readiness.
- Flyway is present only as a non-default Maven profile skeleton; PDR-2C1 baseline schema SQL exists but has not been validated against PostgreSQL yet; PDR-2C2A adds PostgreSQL upsert mapper variants only.
- No production database is connected in this package.
- No migration/rollback pipeline, backup/restore command set, auth/authz evidence, deployment smoke/rollback evidence, observability stack, or complete secrets contract exists yet.

### PDR-2A Database Migration + Rollback Decision Pack

PDR-2A records the production database and migration decisions only. It does not add runtime implementation.

- Production database target: PostgreSQL.
- Migration framework target: Flyway, SQL-first.
- Rollback policy: forward-only migrations plus pre-migration backup and restore.
- Migration execution model: explicit manual pre-deploy migration; application startup must not silently mutate the production schema without a controlled migration process.
- Initial recovery target: RPO 24h and RTO 4h.
- Current schema state: `src/main/resources/schema.sql` remains local/test bootstrap for now.
- No PostgreSQL driver, Flyway dependency, migration SQL, mapper SQL change, production DB connection, backup script, deployment script, secret, auth, Telegram send, Push send, order/execution, or auto-trading semantics are added by PDR-2A.
- Production readiness remains BLOCKED.

Database migration remaining blockers after PDR-2C2A:

- Flyway exists only as a non-default skeleton profile.
- PostgreSQL baseline schema SQL exists but has not been executed against PostgreSQL.
- Mapper PostgreSQL compatibility is partial: AssetState/UserConfig upsert variants are present, DATEADD / FORMATDATETIME compatibility remains pending.
- PostgreSQL driver/Testcontainers validation not added.
- Backup/restore scripts or commands not implemented.
- Auth/access control missing.
- Observability missing.
- Deployment packaging missing.
- Secrets contract incomplete.

Next production-readiness packages:

1. PDR-2C2B Mapper PostgreSQL Date Function Compatibility.
2. PDR-2C3 PostgreSQL Driver + Migration Smoke Validation.
3. PDR-2D Backup/Restore Runbook.

### PDR-2B Flyway Baseline Skeleton

PDR-2B adds the Flyway project skeleton without changing default local/test runtime behavior.

- Flyway dependency scope: explicit non-default Maven profile `flyway-migration` only.
- Migration directory: `src/main/resources/db/migration/` with README placeholder only.
- Executable migration files: none; no `V*.sql` baseline exists yet.
- Current schema state: `src/main/resources/schema.sql` remains local/test bootstrap and is not copied.
- Production target database remains PostgreSQL.
- Real PostgreSQL-compatible baseline migration is deferred to PDR-2C.
- No PostgreSQL driver, production DB connection, schema change, mapper SQL change, application config change, backup script, deployment script, secret, auth, Telegram send, Push send, order/execution, or auto-trading semantics are added by PDR-2B.
- Production readiness remains BLOCKED.

### PDR-2C1 PostgreSQL Baseline Schema SQL

PDR-2C1 adds PostgreSQL-compatible Flyway baseline schema SQL drafts without changing local/test runtime behavior.

- Table migration: `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__baseline_schema_tables.sql`.
- Index migration: `src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__baseline_schema_indexes.sql`.
- Scope: current V1 table and index semantics only.
- JSON-like fields remain `TEXT`; timestamp fields use `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE`; generated numeric ids use PostgreSQL identity columns.
- V1 remains foreign-key-free for this baseline, matching current schema semantics.
- No seed data, schema.sql change, mapper SQL change, Java/config/test change, PostgreSQL driver, Testcontainers, production DB connection, backup script, deployment script, secret, auth, Telegram send, Push send, order/execution, or auto-trading semantics are added by PDR-2C1.
- Mapper compatibility and real PostgreSQL validation remain deferred to PDR-2C2/PDR-2C3.
- Production readiness remains BLOCKED.

### PDR-2C2A Mapper PostgreSQL Upsert Variants

PDR-2C2A adds MyBatis mapper-level PostgreSQL upsert variants without changing default local/test H2 behavior.

- `MyBatisDatabaseIdProviderConfig` maps PostgreSQL to `postgresql`, H2 to `h2`, and MySQL to `mysql` for MyBatis database-specific annotation selection.
- `AssetStateMapper.mergeUpsertCore` keeps the generic H2 `MERGE INTO ... KEY` fallback and adds a PostgreSQL `ON CONFLICT (symbol) DO UPDATE` variant that does not overwrite `hot_reset_*` fields.
- `UserConfigMapper.saveOrUpdate` keeps the generic MySQL/H2 `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` fallback and adds a PostgreSQL `ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE` variant.
- Focused tests prove default H2 upsert behavior still works and annotation guards prove PostgreSQL variants do not contain H2/MySQL upsert syntax.
- DATEADD / FORMATDATETIME mapper compatibility, PostgreSQL driver/Testcontainers validation, production DB connection, backup script, deployment script, secret, auth, Telegram send, Push send, order/execution, and auto-trading semantics remain deferred / blocked.
- Production readiness remains BLOCKED.

## Derived / Compatibility Sources

`docs/ACTIVE_MAINLINE_STATUS.yml` and `docs/CODEX_NEXT_TASK.yml` are derived compatibility files only.
They do not override the Delivery Contract, Delivery Progress Matrix, or this Current State file.

Legacy V1 documents remain historical audit and asset evidence only.
Review-only slice count is no longer a delivery completion standard.

---

## Rule

No production deployment approval or runtime production implementation package may start until a separate explicit production release gate addresses the blocked runtime/config evidence and preserves the permanent no auto-trading / no order-execution safety boundaries. Docs-only production-readiness decision packs may record decisions while keeping deployment readiness BLOCKED.
